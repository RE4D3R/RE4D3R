Hello, I go by the name [Reader].
I like programming, drawing, playing games and watching anime/reading manga.

I'm just starting out as a programmer. I'm really excited about all the
things I can do or will be able to do in the future.

Right now I'm learning Python, but my main goal is C#. I heard that one is
used often for making games, which is what I'm interested in the most!

I'll be in your care! :D
